# ðŸ§® KNN From Scratch (Breast Cancer Dataset)

This project demonstrates the implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm** from scratch in Python and compares it with **scikit-learnâ€™s KNN**.  
The dataset used is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset**.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Custom implementation of **KNN Classifier** without external ML libraries.  
- Comparison with **scikit-learnâ€™s `KNeighborsClassifier`**.  
- Function to find the **best k value** using accuracy plots.  
- **Confusion Matrix visualization** for evaluation.  
- Scatter plot of **Train (dots) vs Test predictions (stars)**.
